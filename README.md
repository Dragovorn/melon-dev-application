My Melon Dev Application (REVIEWER PLEASE READ)
===============================================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Dragovorn/melon-dev-application.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Dragovorn/melon-dev-application)

A couple of things I would like to open with.
1. About unit testing, I began unit testing, but it became apparent that I
could not continue unit testing if I wanted to get this done by the deadline.
So I stopped writing unit tests.
2. I spent most of the last day (2017-1-12) after adding MySQL polishing.

Also if you are really interested in how the code evolved and how I used
GitHub to help me be more efficient with my time please do check the commit
logs and the issue tracker.
